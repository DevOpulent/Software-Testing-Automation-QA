With unit tests covering over 90% of the codebase, I concentrated on a strong testing strategy to make sure the program is secure and functional. I used Black-box and white-box testing to inspect internal code logic and verify outcomes. In order to lower security concerns, I imposed particular validation criteria, including ID length and phone number formatting. I maintained stability by using regression testing, which makes sure that modifications to the code do not affect existing functionality.

Understanding the requirements and business logic is the first step I take in interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program. To make sure the program satisfies user expectations, I created tests centered around particular services like Contact, Appointment, and Task. Additionally, to obtain ongoing input and make program adjustments as user demands change, I employed an automated testing strategy with continuous integration (CI/CD) pipeline.

When approaching software design, I followed disciplined code standards for consistency and efficiency. I considered the broader impact of code changes, using integration testing to ensure the interactions between services are seamless. Implementing CI/CD practices allowed me to frequently integrate new code while maintaining its quality and reliability. To reduce bias, I included negative test scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing is efficient.
